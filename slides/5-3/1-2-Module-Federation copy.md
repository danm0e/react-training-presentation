# Module Federation

### What is Module Federation?

- Allows different JavaScript applications to dynamically share code with each other at runtime.
- enables the creation of a micro-frontend architecture, where multiple independent frontend applications can be composed into a single cohesive user experience.

### What is the problem it solves?

- Tries to solve the challenge of building and maintaining large, complex frontend applications.
- Frontend monoliths can become difficult to scale and maintain as they grow in size and complexity.
- Module federation allows for a more modular and distributed approach, where different parts of an application can be developed and deployed independently.

---

### What are the benefits?

- Improved development efficiency, teams can work on separate parts of an application independently and then integrate them seamlessly.
- Enables better code reuse and sharing across different applications, which can lead to smaller bundle sizes and faster load times for end users
