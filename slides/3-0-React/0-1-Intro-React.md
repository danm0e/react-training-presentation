### Why React

- <a href="https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/#scatterplot_overview">React</a> is the most popular frontend framework on the web
- It has the most stars on github<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The most questions on stackoverflow<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- And the most job listings<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Developed by Facebook<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Declarative, efficient and flexible<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: For facebook React is used on over 100,000 components seen by billions of users every day/

React is a JavaScript / TypeScript framework that lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

You can create components like Button, Thumbnail and others; then combine them into screens, pages and entire applications.
Introduction to React

It’s widely used in building single-page applications, utilises a component based architecture. What this means is that a UI is constructed from reusable building blocks.

### Features of React

- JSX
- Virtual DOM
- One-way Data Binding
- Declarative Syntax
- Component-Based
- Extensibility

Note: 
React distinguishes itself through several key features:

JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension) combines HTML and javascript to create a synatax that is both familiar and powerful

Virtual DOM: React's efficient Virtual DOM minimizes direct manipulation of the actual DOM, enhancing performance by reducing unnecessary updates.

One-Way Data binding: By flowing the data from parent to childn we can guarentee mutations don't disrupt the components meaning they're easier to understand, easier to test, and really efficient in what they do

Declarative Syntax: With a declarative syntax, React makes code more readable and less prone to bugs, enabling developers to focus on the "what" rather than the "how.

Component-Based: The component-based architecture promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for complex UI development.

Extensibility: React has many extensions that we can use to create full-fledged UI applications. It supports mobile app development and provides server-side rendering. React is extended with Flux, Redux, React Native, etc. which helps us to create good-looking UI.
