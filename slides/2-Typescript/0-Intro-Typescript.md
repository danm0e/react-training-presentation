# Typescript
---
### Agenda
- Types: What goes on top of what we've learnt?
- Objects & Arrays: Creating, managing and structuring your data objects.
- Truthy/Fasley Values: What resolves to true and what resolves to false
- Errors & Throwing: How and when to create, throw and handle errors.
---
In this file, you’ll see all the instructions for what you need to implement. Add your code and run the jest command to have it run the tests.

### Why Typescript?
Note: Large applications get unweildy
Dynamic languages result in more errors at runtime
Writing tests to check type safety seems wasteful
IDEs can't easily understand dynamic code


Variables: How do we declare values?
Types: What are types and why do we care?
Objects, Arrays, Tuples & Enums: Creating, managing and structuring your data objects.
Truthy/Falsey Values: What resolves to true and what resolves to false
Errors & Throwing: How and when to create, throw and handle errors.
In this section we’ll be covering:
Variables - declaration, reassignment
Types, what they are and why we care
Objects and arrays
What resolves to true and false
Creating, throwing and handling errors
