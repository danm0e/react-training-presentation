# Typescript

### Agenda
- Types: What goes on top of what we've learnt?
- Objects & Arrays: Creating, managing and structuring your data objects.

### Why Typescript?
- Note: Large applications get unweildy<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Dynamic languages result in more errors at runtime<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Writing tests to check type safety seems wasteful<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- IDEs can't easily understand dynamic code<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Yesterday put me off JavaScript<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Agenda
- Variables: How do we declare values?

- Objects, Arrays, Tuples & Enums: Creating, managing and structuring your data objects.
- Functions: How we can add syntax to describe them
- Classes: Describing objects
- BUT FIRST... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
