# Storybook

### What is Storybook

- Frontend library for building UI components and pages in isolation
- Teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation.
- Open source

### Benefits of Storybook:

- Isolating components and tracking their use cases
- Automated Accessibility, Interaction, and Visual testing,
- Single source of truth for our UI, indexing all components and their various states
- auto-generates documentation from those stories, facilitating knowledge sharing and reuse.

## Note: Isolating components allows us to verify hard-to-reach edge cases of the UI and use addons to mock everything a component needs. This automated testing reduces testing effort and ensures reproducible UI states.
